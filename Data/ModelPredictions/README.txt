These are the files with the data for Figure 5B.

In genomic_distance_from_telomere_vs_displacement_in_FC_strains_wrt_WT_with_chromosome_position.txt there is the displacement (in nm) vs the genomic distance (in base-pairs) to the corresponding telomere of the arm where each locus of about 10kb (9,600bp = 3 particles) is located. The loci in the armR will refer to the TelR, and loci on the armL to the TelL. The locus is assigned to the armL if its centre is located between the TelL and the centromere and to armR if is it located between the centromere and the TelR. The indications of whether the locus is on a Donor/Recipient/NoFused chromosome and whether the telomere of the arm is internal or terminal in the fused chromosome strain are annotated. "Terminal telomere" means that the telomere of the arm is the final part of the chromosome with the fusion and "Internal telomere" means that is not anymore a proper telomere after fusion. For the noFused chromosomes all telomeres are terminal.



In genomic_distance_from_closest_chr_arm_end_vs_displacement_in_FC_strains_wrt_WT_with_chromosome_position.txt

there is the displacement (in nm) vs the genomic distance (in base-pairs) to the closest chromosome arm end. The "chromosome arm end" can be one of the telomeres (assigned as above, so that he loci in the armR will refer to the TelR, and loci on the armL to the TelL) or the centromere of the chromosome. The indications of whether the locus is on a Donor/Recipient/NoFused chromosome and whether the telomere of the arm is internal or terminal in the fused chromosome strain are annotated. "Terminal telomere" means that the telomere of the arm is the final part of the chromosome with the fusion and "Internal telomere" means that is not anymore a proper telomere after fusion. The previous file scatter_plot_distance_from_chr_arm_end_vs_displacement_in_FC.txt contained only a part of this second file.
